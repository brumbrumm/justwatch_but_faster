# justwatch_but_faster

JustWatch App but faster and with more movie/series integration.
For creating better overview of available movies in the subscripted services.


Every streaming service show you all shows and it is hard to choose and find interesting stuff. It almost impossible to filter, there is no functionality to set Movies / Series to Seen or not Interested Status. App should help to get through the streaming TV offers and choose what you like to see.

## Bullet Points

- Simple, only three list Available: Watchlist, Popular, Archive
- No login required
- No account required
- Choose your Streaming services
- Get only one list, choose from Popular list is it must see (Watchlist) or not interested at all (Archive) -> Afterwards wish to Watchlist or Archive
- The Streaming Movie / Series list will be reduced, every Movie / Series in Wachtlist or Archive will not be showed in available movies

## Vision

Creating simple watchlist and archive list. Distinct list with subscrpted services. Like zero e-mail box.

## Build

Compile own apk for android device
```shell
flutter build apk
```

## Knowing issues

## TODO
- add icon
